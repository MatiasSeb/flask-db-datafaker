## About The Project

This app was made based on the premise that i was working in a industrial data visualizer, and i didn't have data to lookup to, while working on the development of it, so i decided to create a fakedata motor (so i don't have to integrate faker to every project), where i can connect to multiple databases and fill them with the necessary data.

Features :

* You can connect to your desired database using the SQLAlchemy db object, so it doesn't have problems connecting to distinct prefix databases (ex: MySQL, and then connecting to a MSSQL db.)
* It will reflect the actual state of you chosen database and table to fill with the fake data.
* You can ONLY connect to one database at a time, and the app will start once you chosen the table you want to fill with fake data, and it will stop once you finish or close it.

## Built With

Made with Python Flask, SQLAlchemy (and db prefix connectors), WTForms & JavaScript. Using PipEnv as a environment and package manager.

## Getting Started

First, you'll need Python installed in your OS or System. Thats the only prerequisite.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

PipEnv

```sh
python -m pip install pipenv
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo in the folder you want to use it, but if you use SQLite i suggest you install or clone it inside your project folder.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MatiasSeb/flask-db-datafaker.git
```

2. Install the app, and run it within the env from pipenv.
```sh
pipenv shell
pipenv install
flask run
```

## Usage

The app is actually based on the premise that i needed a database datafaker motor to make real-time tests on multiple dashboards with industrial-oriented data, like temperatures, the velocity or the m/s that the wind is hitting a sensor, or RPM that the machines have.

All of this data is supposed to come from a PLC or an industrial tool that gives real-time data streaming to a database, as my use case was it.

The use i want this app to give or be given, is to be used inside development
